# Aura Framework version 2 

There are 3 types of project for version 2.

1. Web
1. Cli
1. Web and Cli

Whether you started with cli and at some point of time you want to 
make it as web or vice versa, you can move to Web and Cli easily.

For the current time checkout the readme from the corresponding repos. 
We are [working on the documentation](http://leanpub.com/aurav2).
